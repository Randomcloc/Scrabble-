# Scrabble-
A scrabble-type game made for one player, it allows the player unlimited turns to get the highest score they can with the randomly generated list of letters.
As the game starts, the program creates a randlomly generated list of letters. This is the word-pool that will be used by the player to create words.
Each letter from A-Z has a number of points that will be awareded to the player if that letter is in their created word. 
The goal of the game is for the player to get as much points as possible.
A late-stage improvement would be to include a dictionary from which to check if the word created by the user is a real word.
